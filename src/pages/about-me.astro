        <p>Hello, my name is Bruno Garc√≠a Baldassari.</p>
        <p>
            I'm a Web Developer originally from Uruguay, now living in
            Washington DC.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been working in <strong>web development</strong> for over three
            years. My experience has ranged from both <strong>frontend</strong> and
            <strong>backend</strong>
            technologies, implementing simple tools and databases like <em
                >Express.js</em
            >,
            <em>Web APIs</em> and <em>SQL</em>, as well as robust frameworks and
            libraries that enable fast and safe development cycles like <em
                >Typescript, React, Astro.js</em
            > and <em>Docker</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm a big believer in <strong>Open Source</strong> development and its
            capacity to create a more equitable world. I hope to dedicate my career
            to projects that further improve access to tools and resources for everyone.
        </p>
